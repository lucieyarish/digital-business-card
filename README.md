### Built With

HTML, CSS, React and Vite

### What I Learned

In addition to gaining more confidence with building React projects, I've learned a lot about making my components truly reusable and accessible. I also put into practice what I learned from Bob Ziroll about creating a mental outline of React projects. His advice had helped me tremendously and sped up the built process.

### Resources & Tools

My app wouldn't be what it is without these awesome free tools and resources:
- Vite: https://vitejs.dev/
- Font Awesome: https://fontawesome.com/

### Time Commitment

In total, I spent 5 hours on this project.
